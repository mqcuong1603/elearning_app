# Email Configuration
# For Gmail, you need to create an App Password:
# 1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security
# 2. Enable 2-Factor Authentication
# 3. Go to "App passwords"
# 4. Generate a new app password for "Mail"
# 5. Use that password here

GMAIL_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-app-password-here

# Note: These are set via Firebase CLI:
# firebase functions:config:set gmail.email="your-email@gmail.com"
# firebase functions:config:set gmail.password="your-app-password"
